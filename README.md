C++ Programming 
I have firstly learned Python language after 10th class i find it interesting and i decided to learn more language and explore more things in Tech Sources 
After 12th i started learning C++. Compare to Python C++ was simple to understand for me i thought C++ langauge is tough according to other people but i find it 
interesting and enjoy coding very much
